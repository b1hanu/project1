It comes with firmware source code, as well as a graphical configuration tool. It connects to your computer or tablet over USB.<br>

Our goal was to develop a camera bag that lets you haul your camera up the wall with you as you climb, or use it confidently during treacherous hikes where you may have to do some scrambling, without having to worry about accidentally dropping it. The camera is fully tethered to reduce the risks and consequences of accidental droppage.

                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Imagine a smart electric toothbrush that does the brushing for you.
TALO is a game changing half-mouth toothbrush with brushes that self-adjust to individually clean your teeth and gums the way we're supposed to, all in 20 seconds. It’s important to brush your teeth, but it’s even more important HOW you brush. We put the ADA’s recommended brushing method IN the brush, so all you have to do is use it.
TALO was jointly imagined and designed by top engineers and dentists coming together.  The result is a new looking toothbrush shape that gives you the brushing experience you always wanted…every time you use it. <br></p>

<div><br></div></h1>
                <p class="mbr-text align-center display-5 pb-3 mbr-fonts-style">Modern wireless speakers are all about the clean &amp; minimalist industrial design. Kranio challenges this trend of machined perfection with a design that fuses organic with mechanical. Alan designed Kranio. As an industrial designer, he was frustrated by the lack of soul in modern product design. He loves to express himself through the music he listens to and wants his speakers to do the same. A little square-shaped white speaker just doesn't cut it. 
<br>
<br>Alan knows his stuff. He has years of experience designing figurines for Marvel, DC and other pop culture products, as well as numerous Red Dot and Red Star Awards under his belt.<br></p>

There is no screen or connection to WiFi or Bluetooth. The orientation doesn't matter and the time zone is irrelevant. Its minimal design can be worn on your wrist, kept in your pocket, or held comfortably in your hand. It won't push you notifications, but will silently give the time to you when you tap on the face.
<br>
<br>The timepiece itself is strikingly simple, beautiful, and modern, made of high quality PVD coated stainless steel and polished glass. Engineered to be no larger than a small comfort stone or serenity coin, it is smooth to the touch and substantial in weight and quality.</p>

                <p class="mbr-text align-center display-5 pb-3 mbr-fonts-style">We would like to share some cool things: MOFT Z has been honored with the Red Dot Award Product Design 2020! And the 500K Stretch Goal was unbelievably reached, which means that the MOFT Z Leather Black is officially unlocked!
<br>
People invented various sit-stand desks since many years ago. But these desks didn’t change much more so far. They usually come with a bulky size and limited by the workspace environment. And some with cumbersome setup may let you go crazy.
<br>
<br>To make people get a flexible posture wherever they are, we realized we’d have to come up with the most convenient sit-stand desk ever.
<br>
<br>MOFT Z is a truly lightweight and versatile sit-stand desk at an affordable price. It’s designed to offer THE HEAVEY LAPTOP USER a maximum comfort with maximum freedom on location.<br></p>
